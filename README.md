# Node.js Promise and Async/Await Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Promises and the `fs` module with async/await in Node.js. It includes examples of handling asynchronous operations, creating a promise, and performing file system tasks such as writing data to a file.

## Files
- **app.js**: Contains an example of a simple Promise that resolves a message and logs it to the console.
- **fileOperations.js**: Demonstrates how to create a file (`message.txt`) and write data to it using the `fs` module with async/await.
- **message.txt**: The output file created by `fileOperations.js`, containing a sample message.
- **package.json**: The configuration file for the Node.js project, automatically created with `npm init`.
